///// *** Rule for Declaring the Variable in js *** /////////

    //* Info *// you can check the notes for this too 

    //* Info *// 1. java script allow to change the datatype of the variable at the runtime as we can see in the code above

    ///* Info *// 2. you can start a variable with $ , _ or a letter but not with number

    //* Info *// let 2fasih = 7 // this will throw an error, commenting so we can run the rest code easily

    //* Info *// 3. and javascript reserved word can not be used as variable

    //* Info *// let var = 7 // this will throw an erorr too.

///// *** end block *** /////////
